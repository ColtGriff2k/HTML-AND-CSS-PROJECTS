                        Grace Hopper was a trailblazer in computer science and military service — combining deep
                        mathematical training, wartime service in the Navy, and pioneering work in programming
                        languages. Her insistence on making programming accessible (via English-based languages) and her
                        standardization efforts helped shape the modern era of software. Her life also stands as an
                        example of how one can bridge academia, military service, and industry impact.

            </a>
            <p>
                Grace Hopper was born in 1906 in New York City and showed curiosity early—famously taking apart clocks
                just to see how they worked. She studied mathematics and physics at Vassar College, graduating in 1928,
                then earned her master’s and PhD in mathematics from Yale. After completing her doctorate, she returned
                to Vassar as a math professor.

                <h3>Career</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Hopper joined the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II and worked on the Harvard Mark I, one of the
                earliest electromechanical computers. After the war she helped develop the UNIVAC I and pioneered the
                compiler—software that translates human-readable instructions into machine code. Her work led directly
                to FLOW-MATIC and later COBOL, an English-like programming language that transformed business computing.
                Throughout her Navy and industry roles, she championed practical, user-friendly programming and helped
                standardize major languages.

            </a>
            <p>
                Hopper retired from the Navy in 1986 as a Rear Admiral, one of the oldest active-duty officers at the
                time. She spent her later years speaking, consulting at Digital Equipment Corporation, and inspiring
                generations of technologists with her humor and clarity. Posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of
                Freedom, she remains celebrated as a computing pioneer whose vision made programming more accessible and
                shaped modern software development.

                Hopper framed computing’s future around four interlinked themes: data, hardware, software, and people.
                She argued that advances in computing hinge not just on machines or code, but on how we handle data and
                how people lead and adapt.
            </p>
            <p>
                She used vivid analogies: for example, when one ox couldn’t move a log, you didn’t breed a bigger ox—you
                used two oxen. She likened that to computing: instead of just building a bigger computer, use multiple
                computers working together.

            <p>
                She addressed information protection and system architecture: how as computing grows, the challenge
                isn’t
                just more speed or capacity, but how data is managed, shared, secured, and how hardware and software
                interoperate.

                Hopper stressed the importance of people, leadership, and risk-taking: She believed that training young
                people and encouraging them to “try it” has been among her most significant achievements. Long lost to
                time because it was recorded on media no longer supported by modern playback equipment, the lecture was
                recently recovered and released to the world. You can watch it in two parts below.

                The Grace Hopper Celebration event features hundreds of sessions including technical talks, career
                workshops, culture panels, and hands-on learning opportunities. Networking is a central
                component—there’s an expo where attendees connect with top tech organizations, plus informal spaces for
                meet-ups and peer conversations. It emphasizes professional growth, skill-building, and community
                support—especially for women and under-represented groups in tech.
